      <p> These two powerhouse teams both have a good shot at becoming this years Super Bowl champions. If I had to choose one team to take it I would have to say the Rams. The Rams are a team who is thirsty for a Super Bowl ring and honestly they are ready. On the other hand the Browns are a great contender, but this is their first year with this team and they still need to clean things up and tie up loose ends. </p>
