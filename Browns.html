               <p> The Browns have completely recreated their team. Somehow they were able to generate one of the best defenses in the league. With one of the best rookie cornerbacks to play the sport, Denzel Ward, carries this defense with already three interceptions and multiple swats of the ball. This team has over 10 turnovers on defense which is the highest in the league. Most can agree that without this high grade defense this team would still be in the dirt where it ended last year. Now switching gears to the reconstructed offense of the Browns. With their new rookie quarterback Baker Mayfield finally earning his start over Tyrod Taylor, the offense seems to have turned a new leaf. With Jarvis Landry joining the receiver squad starting with Antonio Callaway, the pass game for the Browns is extremely powerful. Even though they gave up on Josh Gordon, an extremely talented receiver, to the Patriots, this opens a spot for a receiver who will hopefully be fit enough to be more involved in games. </p>
