                  <p>The Rams are somehow still undefeated being 5-0. This team which is now absolutely stacked has some serious power in the league. With a Jared Goff in quarterback position throwing to some amazing new wide receivers such as Brando Cooks. This connection between these two players alone makes a fair catching game, but what really throws off teams is the powerful running game. Todd Gurley who is the running back for the Rams and also the voice of the Rams since on social media he is always praising and raising the bar for and to the Rams. He knows how “stacked” they are in every position, but every great offense needs a great defense. Even though their defense isn’t anything to gaga about it still helps make this team one of the only two undefeated teams in the league. With the star cornerback from the Super Bowl champions the Broncos, Aqib Talib has helped set thos defense on the pace it needs to go and he plays a huge role and jamming up other teams pass opportunities. </p>
